**📈 Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

**📝 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to estimate the expected return of a stock and its relationship with market risk. Using historical stock and market index data, the analysis calculates beta, alpha, and expected returns to assess the stock's risk-adjusted performance.

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

- **Python Libraries:**

- **pandas & numpy:** Data manipulation and calculations

- **yfinance:** Fetching historical financial data

**matplotlib:** Visualizing returns and regression analysis

**🔍 Workflow**

**Data Collection:**

- Historical stock data (e.g., Apple - AAPL)

- Market index data (e.g., S&P 500 - ^GSPC)

**Data Preprocessing:**

- Calculated daily returns for the stock and market index.

**CAPM Analysis:**

- Calculated beta (measure of stock volatility relative to the market).

- Estimated alpha (intercept) using linear regression.

- Analyzed stock performance using the CAPM equation.

**📈 Key Insights**

- Beta: Determines the stock's sensitivity to market movements.

- Alpha: Indicates if the stock performed better or worse than expected based on its beta.

- Expected return estimates provide insights into whether the stock is undervalued or overvalued.
 
**🖥️ Results**

- Quantified beta, alpha, and expected return metrics to support investment decisions.
